    <h1>Student Housing Scam Simulation</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This simulation will help you learn how to rent your first home safely and avoid scams.</p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You will be presented with a fake housing marketplace similar to Facebook Marketplace.</li>
        <li>You can choose from a few listings, some of which may be suspicious.</li>
        <li>You will chat with a simulated landlord (AI Agent) for your chosen listing.</li>
        <li>After the chat, you'll receive a summary of your performance, highlighting good questions you asked and any missed opportunities or red flags.</li>
    </ol>
